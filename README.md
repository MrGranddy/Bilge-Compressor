This is my image compressor project, for now it only
compresses images using Singular Value Decomposition
but I will add other features like converting images
to PDF files, or selecting the images to processs
automatically by sorting them by their name or 
modification date. For now you can use my program to
basically compress your images by the parameters you
want.

Requirements:
  * Bilge uses scipy.misc.pilutil and numpy modules, make sure you have them.
  
How to use?
  
  For now there is no user interface to use but you can use my functions as you want.
  
Details:
-------------------
|  **`Bilge is written with Python 3.5.2`**  |
